conversation just like a real person  machine learning technology is set to revolutionise almost any area of human life and work  and so will affect all our lives  and so you are likely to want to find out more about it  machine learning has a reputation for being one of the most complex areas of computer science  requiring advanced mathematics and engineering skills to understand it  while it is true that working as a machine learning engineer does involve a lot of mathematics and programming  we believe that anyone can understand the basic concepts of machine learning  and given the importance of this technology  everyone should  the big ai breakthroughs sound like science fiction  but they come down to a simple idea  the use of data to train statistical algorithms  in this course you will learn to understand the basic idea of machine learning  even if you don t have any background in math or programming  not only that  you will get hands on and use user friendly tools developed at goldsmiths  university of london to actually do a machine learning project  training a computer to recognise images  this course is for a lot of different people  it could be a good first step into a technical career in machine learning  after all it is always better to start with the high level concepts before the technical details  but it is also great if your role is non technical  you might be a manager or other non technical role in a company that is considering using machine learning  you really need to understand this technology  and this course is a great place to get that
